# PacMan

A simple, mostly working version of Pacman in Java, created as a Radford Principles of CS 2 introductory project.

### Build

This Java project was built with the NetBeans IDE but all that is needed to build/run the java files is `javac` - simply compile the `.java` files and then run `Main`.
